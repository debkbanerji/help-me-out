            <h2>About Service Ninja</h2>
            <p>Service Ninja is an application that connects people with the services that they need, by sorting them
                based on priority. The priority is calculated by taking into account both the time of the request and
                the urgency of the request using a geometric progression.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Each level of urgency adds to the time of the request a different offset before sorting
            <p>Critical: 30 minutes</p>
            <p>Very Urgent: 1 hour</p>
            <p>Urgent: 2 hours</p>
            <p>Important: 4 hours</p>
            <p>Take Your Time: 8 hours</p>
